# 0x01-python_async_function



**Title:** Async Python Project

**Author:** Graham Olusiekwin

**Project Start Date:** March 18, 2024, 6:00 AM

**Project End Date (Deadline):** March 19, 2024, 6:00 AM

**Checker Released At:** March 18, 2024, 12:00 PM

**Auto-Review:** An auto-review will be launched at the deadline.

## Description

This project delves into asynchronous programming in Python using the `async` and `await` keywords. We'll explore how to effectively leverage asynchronous I/O with the `asyncio` library and optimize program execution through concurrency.

## Resources

* **Read or Watch:**
    * Async IO in Python: A Complete Walkthrough (link to resource)
    * asyncio - Asynchronous I/O documentation (link to documentation)
    * random.uniform documentation (link to documentation)
* **Checker:** Released at March 18, 2024, 12:00 PM (details about the checker will likely be provided separately)

## Learning Objectives

By the completion of this project, you'll be able to:

* **Explain the `async` and `await` syntax** without external assistance.
* **Execute an asynchronous program** using the `asyncio` library.
* **Run concurrent coroutines** for efficient execution.
* **Create tasks** within the `asyncio` framework.
* **Utilize functions** from the `random` module.

## Submission Requirements

* **README.md:** This file (you're reading it now!) must reside at the project's root directory.
* **Code Editors:** Only `vi`, `vim`, or `emacs` are permitted for code development.
* **Execution Environment:** All code will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.7).
* **Newlines:** All code files must end with a newline character.
* **Executable Files:** All code files should be executable.
* **Code Length:** The length of your code will be measured using `wc`.
* **Shebang Line:** The first line of each code file must be: `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
* **Code Style:** Adhere to the `pycodestyle` style guide (version 2.5.x).
* **Type Annotations:** All functions and coroutines must have type annotations.
* **Module Documentation:** Each module should include docstrings explaining its purpose. You can verify docstring presence using: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`
* **Function Documentation:** Document individual functions within modules. Use: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` to verify docstrings.
* **Docstring Quality:** Docstrings are not just simple words; they should be descriptive sentences explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method. The length and quality of docstrings will be evaluated.

## Additional Notes

* Feel free to replace `[Your Specific Project Name Here]` with the actual name of your project.
* Include links to the resources mentioned for better accessibility.
* Consider adding any specific instructions related to the checker or project structure (if applicable).

I hope this draft helps you create an informative and comprehensive README file for your project!
